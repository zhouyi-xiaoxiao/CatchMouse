# CatchMouse

Jump the mouse cursor between displays with a global keyboard shortcut.

A modern, **Apple-Silicon-native** reimplementation of the classic
[CatchMouse](https://github.com/round/CatchMouse) utility (v1.2, ftnew.com,
2011), which shipped only as a 32/64-bit **Intel** binary and runs on Apple
Silicon Macs solely through Rosetta. This is a clean rewrite in Swift — it
builds and runs natively on `arm64`, with no original code or assets reused.

## Why

The original `CatchMouse.app` is a `i386` + `x86_64` Mach-O with no published
source, so it cannot be rebuilt or recompiled for Apple Silicon. This project
reproduces its behaviour — move the cursor to a chosen display instantly — as a
small, dependency-free menu-bar agent built with the modern toolchain.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Per-display hotkeys** — `⌃⌘,` / `⌃⌘.` / `⌃⌘/` warp the cursor to the
  centre of the **left / centre / right** display.
- 🔁 **Cycle** — `⌃⌥→` / `⌃⌥←` move to the next / previous display, wrapping
  around.
- ⚙️ **Customisable** — set your own shortcut for each display (and for cycling)
  in the **Preferences** window; bindings are saved per monitor and survive
  reconnects.
- 🔢 **Identify Displays** — flash a big number on each screen so you know which
  is which.
- 🧭 **Menu-bar agent** — lives in the menu bar (no Dock icon); the menu lists
  every attached display and its size, and updates live as you plug monitors
  in and out.
- 🔓 **No Accessibility permission required** — cursor movement uses
  `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` rather than synthetic events.
- ⌨️ **Scriptable** — the same actions are available as CLI verbs, so you can
  bind them to your own launcher or window manager.
- 🏎️ **Native** — universal `arm64 + x86_64` binary; no Rosetta on Apple Silicon.

## Install

### Build from source

Requires the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). A full Xcode
install is **not** needed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhouyi-xiaoxiao/CatchMouse.git
cd CatchMouse
./build_app.sh
```

This produces `build/CatchMouse.app`. Move it to `/Applications` and launch it:

```sh
cp -R build/CatchMouse.app /Applications/
open /Applications/CatchMouse.app
```

A cursor icon appears in the menu bar. The app launches as a background agent,
so there is no Dock icon or window.

## Usage

### Global hotkeys

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `⌃⌘,` / `⌃⌘.` / `⌃⌘/` | Jump to the left / centre / right display |
| `⌃⌥→` | Move to the next display |
| `⌃⌥←` | Move to the previous display |

Displays are ordered left → right by their position in the global desktop, so
`⌃⌘,` is the left-most display, `⌃⌘.` the centre and `⌃⌘/` the right. (With more
than three displays, `,` `.` `/` map to the first three; use `⌃⌥→` / `⌃⌥←` to
reach the rest.)

**Customise shortcuts:** open **Preferences…** from the menu-bar icon, click any
recorder and press the combination you want (⎋ cancels, ⌫ clears). Each
display's binding is stored per monitor by its UUID, so it sticks even after you
unplug and replug. **Identify Displays** flashes a number on every screen so you
can tell them apart.

### Command line

Running the binary with an argument performs a single action and exits — handy
for scripting or binding to another tool:

```sh
CatchMouse --list        # list displays: number, id, size, position
CatchMouse --move 2      # warp the cursor to the centre of display 2
CatchMouse --move-next   # warp to the next display
CatchMouse --move-prev   # warp to the previous display
```

(The binary inside the bundle is at
`build/CatchMouse.app/Contents/MacOS/CatchMouse`.)

## Development

```sh
swift build            # debug build
swift run CatchMouse --list
./build_app.sh         # release .app bundle (universal when possible)
```

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `DisplayManager.swift` | Enumerate displays, compute centres, warp the cursor |
| `HotKeyCenter.swift`   | Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` wrapper for global hotkeys |
| `AppDelegate.swift`    | Wires hotkeys + menu together, reacts to display changes |
| `StatusMenuController.swift` | The menu-bar status item and its menu |
| `CLI.swift`            | Scriptable `--list` / `--move*` verbs |
